## West Texas

Throughout this course, we will use different data sets to demonstrate various principles of data and spatial science. The data sets all have in common an underlying geographic coordinate system from which the sample data are derived. The first data set we will use comes from a West Texas, Permian Basin, Oil Field. The data we will analyze come from electrical and geophysical well logs that record rock properties such as formation structural elevation, formation thickness, the type of rock, porosity, and permeability. While the data set itself comes from the petroleum industry, it serves well to explain the basic process of data ingestion into R and RMarkdown and the introduction to exploratory data analytics.
